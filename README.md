# Fast-BTree

A pretty-fast B+ tree implementation ported from [tlx library](https://github.com/tlx/tlx).

## TODO

- [ ] Add more tests

- [ ] use `<Q> where K: Borrow<Q>` trick to border the key type. (e.g. &str for String)

- [ ] Better abstraction (especially for those weird traits)

- [ ] Benchmark
